# /ralph:review — codebase analysis

Run a structured, read-only codebase review: $ARGUMENTS

You change NOTHING except two artifacts: `review-output/findings.json`
(the tracked backlog — source of truth) and
`review-output/REVIEW_REPORT.md` (derived, regenerated every run). You
never commit and never create branches — inspect the results, commit
them yourself, or let an improve cycle carry them inside its fix PR.

## Scope resolution
1. Categories: `--focus` (comma-separated) if given; else
   `.claude/ralph.json` → `reviewFocus` if non-empty; else all five:
   security, bug, code-quality, test-coverage, architecture.
2. Targets: `--target <path>` if given; else `.claude/ralph.json` →
   `sourceDirs` if non-empty; else infer the repo's primary source
   files from its layout and CLAUDE.md — and state the inference in
   your report.
3. `--diff-base <ref>`: restrict targets to files in
   `git diff --name-only <ref>...HEAD` that also fall under step 2's
   targets. Record the ref in the findings `scope.diffBase` (empty
   string when not used).

## Procedure
1. Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/reviewing-codebase/SKILL.md` — it
   defines the findings schema (including `addressed`), the severity
   rubric, per-category analysis techniques, anti-patterns, and the
   accumulation/dedup rules. Follow it exactly.
2. Load the existing backlog if `review-output/findings.json` exists:
   note the highest existing finding id, every existing finding's
   title/file/category (dedup context), and every `addressed` value
   (these must survive untouched).
3. Dispatch ONE subagent per category — all in a single message so they
   run in parallel. Each subagent is read-only (instruct it: analysis
   only, no Write/Edit, no state changes) and receives: its category;
   that category's section from the skill's "Category Analysis
   Techniques"; the "Severity Rubric" table with its calibration rules;
   the anti-patterns list; the resolved target file list; the titles of
   existing findings in its category (do not re-report these); and this
   output contract — final message is a RAW JSON ARRAY of finding
   objects (no prose, no markdown fences, no `id` and no `addressed`
   fields: the orchestrator assigns both), each with
   category/severity/file/line?/title/description/suggestion/effort/references?.
   If a subagent returns anything unparseable, re-dispatch it once;
   twice unparseable = drop that category and say so in the report.
4. Merge per the skill's "Accumulation and Deduplication Rules": drop
   duplicates of existing findings and cross-category duplicates (same
   root cause); assign sequential ids continuing from the highest
   existing; new findings get `"addressed": null`; existing findings
   keep their `addressed` values; recompute `summary` over ALL
   findings.
5. Write `review-output/findings.json` (create the directory if
   needed) using the skill's file structure — project (repo name),
   reviewDate (today), scope {target, diffBase, focus}, summary,
   findings. Validate with real commands and show the output:
   `jq -e '.summary.total == (.findings | length)'
   review-output/findings.json` must print `true`.
6. Regenerate `review-output/REVIEW_REPORT.md` from the merged
   findings: title + reviewDate + scope line; a summary table (counts
   by severity); then one section per severity in rubric order, each
   finding rendered as `### F-xxx [severity] title` with file:line,
   description, suggestion, and `addressed` status; end with an "Open
   vs addressed" count line.
7. Report: new findings vs pre-existing (counts by severity), the top
   findings by severity, the scope actually used, and both artifact
   paths. If `git check-ignore review-output/findings.json` exits 0,
   WARN prominently: an ignored backlog vanishes in worktrees and
   fresh clones and defeats the improve loop (plugin README, "Artifact
   tracking").
