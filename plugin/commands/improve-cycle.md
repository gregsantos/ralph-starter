# /ralph:improve-cycle — the improve unit of work

You are running ONE bounded improvement cycle, headlessly, inside a
dedicated git worktree (or a routine's fresh clone) prepared by
/ralph:improve. Hard caps (--max-turns, --max-budget-usd) are already on
this process.

## Guard — before anything else
The current branch must match `ralph/improve-*` and `git status` must be
clean. If either fails — you are in someone's real checkout, or on a
default branch — ABORT immediately with a clear message and change
NOTHING. Do not create a branch to fix this; the launcher owns setup.

## Phase I-1 — Review
Execute the full procedure in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/commands/review.md`
(Read it), no arguments — config-driven scope. Result: an updated
`review-output/findings.json` and report, uncommitted.

## Phase I-2 — Select
1. N = `.claude/ralph.json` → `defaultBudgets.improveFindings`, else 3.
2. Candidates: findings with `addressed` null-or-absent and severity !=
   info, ordered critical → high → medium → low (ties: lower id first).
3. PR-overlap filter: `gh pr list --state open --json number,headRefName`;
   for each open `ralph/*` PR, `gh pr diff <number> --name-only`; drop
   any candidate whose `file` appears in any of those diffs (someone is
   already touching it). If gh fails (no GitHub remote), say so and
   skip this filter.
4. Revalidate each remaining candidate against the working tree: the
   cited file exists and the described symptom is still present at the
   cited location (read it). A candidate that fails revalidation is
   dropped AND marked in the backlog: `addressed: "stale-<today>"` —
   humans fix things too, and the next cycle must not re-chew it.
5. Take the top N. If ZERO remain: write the backlog only if step 4
   changed it, run the Cleanup section, and end with "improve: no
   actionable findings this cycle" — a successful empty cycle, not an
   error.

## Phase I-3 — Fix-spec
1. Write the selected findings (full objects, unmodified) to the
   sidecar scratch file `"$(pwd).selected.json"` (i.e.
   `/tmp/ralph-improve-<ts>.selected.json`, OUTSIDE the worktree so
   build.md's clean-tree preflight never sees it), shaped
   `{"findings": [...]}` — deleted in Cleanup.
2. Execute `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/commands/spec.md`'s full procedure
   (Read it) with the input
   `--from-findings "$(pwd).selected.json"`. Name the spec's
   `project` field "Improve <today YYYY-MM-DD>"; if
   `specs/improve-<date>.json` already exists, append `-<HHMM>` to the
   project name and slug.
3. Commit the review artifacts NOW:
   `git add review-output && git commit -m "chore: review backlog for improve cycle"`
   — build.md's preflight requires a clean tree apart from the target
   spec file, and the backlog state that selected these findings
   belongs in the PR diff.
4. If spec generation aborts, run Cleanup and report the abort
   honestly. Never build without a validated spec.

## Phase I-4 — Build
Execute `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/commands/build.md` (Read it) exactly, as
the orchestrator, with the generated spec path as its argument. You are
already on the `ralph/improve-*` branch — build.md keeps you on it and
commits the fresh spec via its Phase 1 step 3a. Every build.md rule
applies unchanged: caps, `.ralph-goal` lifecycle, script-produced
evidence, builder/verifier dispatches, single push at PR time, draft
partial PR on terminal stops, never merge, no attribution lines.

## Phase I-5 — Backlog reconciliation (ONLY if build.md reported a created PR)
1. In `review-output/findings.json`, set `addressed` to the PR number
   for every finding the spec's tasks cite (task descriptions carry
   "fixes F-xxx" per the fix-spec rules).
2. Commit: `chore: mark findings addressed by PR #<number>`.
3. Push that ONE commit to the same, already-open PR branch
   (`git push`). This is the improve cycle's single sanctioned post-PR
   push — the backlog update must land inside the PR that it
   references. Nothing else is ever pushed after it.
If no PR exists (gh unavailable, partial stop), skip all three steps
and say so — the findings stay open for the next cycle.

## Cleanup — every terminal path (success, empty, abort, partial)
1. Delete `"$(pwd).selected.json"` and `.ralph-goal` if present.
2. Remove the pid sidecar `"$(pwd).pid"` LAST, if present (foreground
   and routine runs have none) — its absence tells the launcher's next
   tick this cycle ended.
3. Final message: what happened (PR URL, partial, empty, or abort),
   which findings were addressed/stale-marked, and that the worktree
   can be removed with `git worktree remove <path>` once the PR is
   merged or the work inspected.
