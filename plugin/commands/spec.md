# /ralph:spec — spec generator

Generate a Ralph spec from: $ARGUMENTS

You produce exactly one file: `specs/<slug>.json`. You do NOT commit, do
NOT create branches, and do NOT implement anything — spec generation is a
read-analyze-write activity. Committing happens later: `/ralph:build`'s
preflight commits a freshly generated spec on its work branch (Phase 1
step 3a), whether reached directly or via the /ralph:dev pipeline.

## Input (exactly one source; zero or several → abort, printing this Input section as usage)
- Bare text, or `-p "<text>"` → inline description of what to build.
- `-f <path>` → requirements read from that file. Abort if unreadable.
- `--from-findings [path]` → fix-spec from a findings backlog. Default
  path `review-output/findings.json`. Abort if the file is missing or
  not valid JSON.

## Procedure
1. Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/writing-ralph-specs/SKILL.md` and
   follow it for everything about spec content: the schema, task
   fields and their initial values, acceptance-criteria quality, and —
   for --from-findings — its "Fix-specs from review findings" rules.
2. Study the repo before writing: CLAUDE.md (conventions), the source
   files the work would touch, existing `specs/` for naming. Tasks must
   name real files and real commands.
3. Determine `context.verificationCommands`, in priority order:
   a. `.claude/ralph.json` → `verificationCommands`, if non-empty.
   b. The repo's documented test/lint commands (CLAUDE.md, README,
      Makefile targets, package.json scripts) — confirm a candidate is
      really defined (the target/script exists) before using it.
   c. Neither yields anything → ABORT: "cannot emit an unbuildable
      spec — no verification commands found. Add verificationCommands
      to .claude/ralph.json or state them in the request." Never invent
      commands.
4. Write `specs/<slug>.json` — slug is the lowercase, hyphenated form
   of the spec's `project` field (the same derivation /ralph:build uses
   for its branch name). If that file already exists: ABORT and report
   the collision — never overwrite an existing spec.
5. Validate by running
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/ralph-evidence.sh specs/<slug>.json`
   and printing its real output. Exit 2 or 3 → fix the spec file and
   re-run; if you cannot get exit 0, ABORT and report exactly what is
   invalid (leave the file in place for inspection).
6. Tracking check: run `git check-ignore specs/<slug>.json`. Exit 0
   means the spec is gitignored — WARN prominently in your report: a
   gitignored spec cannot be committed, silently vanishes in worktrees
   and fresh clones, and /ralph:build will refuse it at Phase 1 step 3a
   (see the plugin README's "Artifact tracking" for the one-line
   migration).
7. Report: spec path; project name; a task table (id, title, effort,
   dependsOn); the verificationCommands and which source (3a or 3b)
   supplied them; the evidence-script output; and the next step —
   `/ralph:build specs/<slug>.json`.

## Content rules (enforced on top of the skill)
- tasks[] initial state: `status: "pending"`, `passes: false`,
  `attempts: 0`, `notes: ""`; top-level `verifier` omitted or null.
- ids sequential T-001, T-002, …; every `dependsOn` entry names an
  existing task id; no dependency cycles.
- Tasks atomic — one fresh-context builder session each; prefer 2–6
  tasks; split anything larger.
- Every acceptance criterion is checkable by running a command or
  inspecting a named file — no "works correctly".
