description: Ralph dev pipeline — generate a spec, then build it; --review pauses for approval
argument-hint: '"<what to build>" [--review]'

# /ralph:dev — spec → build pipeline

Run the full Ralph pipeline for: $ARGUMENTS

Two phases: Phase A generates and validates a spec exactly as /ralph:spec
does; Phase B executes /ralph:build's procedure on the result. You are
one session throughout — in Phase B you become the build ORCHESTRATOR
with everything that implies (you never edit source files; builders
build). A slash command cannot invoke another slash command — you compose
them by reading the command files below and executing their procedures.

## Phase A — spec
1. Strip `--review` from the arguments if present and remember it. The
   remaining arguments are the spec input (same three source forms as
   /ralph:spec: bare/-p text, -f <file>, --from-findings [path]).
2. Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/commands/spec.md` and execute its full
   procedure on that input — every rule applies (single input source,
   the skill, verificationCommands sourcing, no overwrite, evidence-
   script validation, tracking check, no commit). Skip only its closing
   "next step" suggestion; this pipeline continues below instead.
3. If spec generation aborted for any reason: STOP and report the abort
   reason. Never proceed to build without a validated spec file.

## Gate — only when --review was passed
Present the spec (project, task table, verificationCommands) and END
YOUR TURN asking for approval. Proceed only after the user approves; if
they request changes, edit the spec file, re-run the evidence-script
validation, and ask again. Without --review, proceed immediately.
(--review is meaningless in a headless run — no one can answer; the
session will simply end after Phase A with the spec written and
reported, which is the correct, safe outcome.)

## Phase B — build
Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/commands/build.md` and execute it exactly as
written, as the orchestrator, with Phase A's spec path as its argument.
Its preflight handles the work branch and commits the still-uncommitted
spec file (Phase 1 step 3a). Every rule applies unchanged: the caps, the
`.ralph-goal` lifecycle, evidence blocks produced by really running the
script, builder and verifier dispatches, single push at PR time, draft
partial PRs on terminal stops, never merging, no attribution lines.

Final report: the spec path and how it was produced, then the build
outcome exactly as build.md's terminal phase reports it.
