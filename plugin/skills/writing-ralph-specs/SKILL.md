description: Creates structured JSON specs for Ralph plugin autonomous builds. Use when creating feature specs, fix-specs from review findings, or task lists for the /ralph:spec → /ralph:build workflow. Triggers on "create a spec", "plan this feature", "spec out", or when features need implementation planning.

# Writing Ralph Specs

Create JSON specs in `specs/` for autonomous execution via `/ralph:build`.
The spec is the single source of truth for a build: the orchestrator
selects tasks from it, records task state in it, and completion evidence
is derived from it. Write it as if no one will be around to clarify
intent later — for an autonomous build, no one will be.

## Spec skeleton

```json
{
  "project": "Feature Name",
  "description": "One-line description",
  "context": {
    "currentState": "What exists today",
    "targetState": "What we want to achieve",
    "constraints": ["Constraint 1"],
    "verificationCommands": ["make check"]
  },
  "tasks": []
}
```

`context.verificationCommands` is REQUIRED and must be non-empty:
`/ralph:build` refuses to start without it (its evidence script exits 3 —
unverifiable builds don't run). List only commands that actually exist
in the target repo.

## Task fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Yes | Unique identifier ("T-001", "T-002", …) |
| `title` | string | Yes | Short action title |
| `description` | string | Yes | What to do, self-contained — the builder sees only this task card and the repo, never the conversation that produced the spec |
| `acceptanceCriteria` | string[] | Yes | Specific, executable/checkable criteria |
| `dependsOn` | string[] | Yes | Task ids that must pass first (empty array if none) |
| `status` | string | Yes | `pending` \| `in_progress` \| `complete` \| `blocked` — initialize as `pending` |
| `passes` | boolean | Yes | Initialize `false`; the orchestrator sets `true` when the task verifies |
| `effort` | string | Yes | `small` \| `medium` \| `large` |
| `notes` | string | Yes | Initialize `""`; the orchestrator records builder notes and failure reasons here |
| `attempts` | number | No | Initialize `0`; the orchestrator increments it per failed build attempt and blocks the task at 2 |

Build-managed fields — initialize but never pre-fill: `status`, `passes`,
`notes`, `attempts`, and the top-level `verifier` field (omit it or set
`null`; the build writes `{verdict, date, summary}` on verifier PASS).

## Acceptance criteria quality

Bad (vague, unfalsifiable):

```json
"acceptanceCriteria": ["Works correctly", "Is fast"]
```

Good (specific, executable):

```json
"acceptanceCriteria": [
  "Retry on HTTP 429, 500, 502, 503, 504",
  "Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s",
  "--max-retries flag added (default: 3)",
  "--help text documents the new flag",
  "make check passes"
]
```

Include documentation criteria for user-facing changes: CLI flags →
help text + reference docs; config options → config comments + README;
workflow changes → README.

## Fix-specs from review findings (--from-findings)

Converting a findings backlog (`review-output/findings.json`) into a
buildable spec:

1. Skip `info` findings — observations don't need fix tasks.
2. Group related findings by file/module — one task per root cause, not
   one per symptom.
3. Order tasks critical → high → medium → low.
4. Turn each finding's `suggestion` into acceptance criteria; keep them
   executable.
5. Map finding `effort` directly to task `effort`.
6. Cite source finding ids in the task description ("fixes F-001,
   F-004") so the backlog can be reconciled later.
7. Every task carries the criterion "existing verification commands
   still pass".
8. Use `dependsOn` when one fix builds on another.

## Tips

- **Atomic tasks**: each task is one fresh-context builder session;
  prefer 2–6 tasks per spec and split anything larger.
- **Self-contained descriptions**: name the exact files and commands
  involved.
- **Testable criteria**: at least one criterion per task should be a
  command the builder can run.
- **dependsOn discipline**: only real ordering constraints; no cycles.
