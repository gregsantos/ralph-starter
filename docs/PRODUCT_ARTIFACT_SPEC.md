## Usage

```bash
# Generate product artifacts (default paths)
./ralph.sh product

# Custom context and output directories
./ralph.sh product --context ./my-input/ --output ./my-output/

# Use a different artifact spec
./ralph.sh product --artifact-spec ./docs/MY_SPEC.md

# Dry run to preview configuration
./ralph.sh product --dry-run
```

### Directory Setup

Before running product mode, create your context directory with source materials:

```
product-input/
├── vision.md           # Product vision and goals
├── research.md         # User research findings
├── requirements.md     # Business requirements
├── constraints.md      # Technical/business constraints
└── competitors.md      # Competitive intelligence
```

Artifacts will be generated to:

```
product-output/
├── 1_executive_summary.md
├── 2_charter.md
├── ...
└── 12_go_to_market.md
```
