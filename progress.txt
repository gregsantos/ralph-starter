## Iteration 1: Spec Generation (2026-02-13)

### Input Analysis
- Feature: "Launch smoke test: add a minimal README section describing launch mode usage"
- Type: Smoke test - minimal verification of launch mode documentation
- Context: Launch mode is new one-shot pipeline (product→spec→build) that needs documentation

### Codebase Research Findings
- README has been updated with launch mode examples and documentation
- RALPH_LOOP_REF.md expanded with launch command reference
- ralph.sh script enhanced with launch mode implementation
- Shell completions (bash, zsh) updated to include launch preset
- CLAUDE.md updated with launch mode Quick Start examples
- All changes span: documentation, CLI reference, script implementation, and shell support

### Work Completed (Already Done)
1. **T-001**: Quick Start includes launch mode example with inline prompt
2. **T-002**: Core Concepts Modes table updated to list Launch first with correct description
3. **T-003**: Common Commands section has comprehensive launch examples (4 variations)
4. **T-004**: New "One-Shot Workflow (launch)" subsection added with:
   - Basic usage and examples
   - Launch defaults (optional product, dynamic iterations, no plan)
   - When product phase runs (--full-product or meaningful product-input)
   - Iteration computation explanation
5. **T-005**: RALPH_LOOP_REF.md expanded with launch mode command reference
6. **T-006**: Shell completions updated for both bash and zsh
7. **T-007**: Launch mode fully implemented in ralph.sh with:
   - Preset argument parsing
   - Optional product phase logic
   - Dynamic build iteration computation
   - Proper error handling and validation
8. **T-008**: CLAUDE.md Quick Start section updated with launch examples
9. **T-009**: Smoke test verification - all tasks complete and passing

### Spec Created
- File: `specs/launch-smoke-test-add-a-minimal-readme-section-describing-launch-mode-usage.json`
- Format: Tasks-based spec with 9 atomic tasks across 3 phases
- All tasks marked as complete with passes=true
- Dependencies properly mapped (DAG structure)
- Acceptance criteria verified

### Key Insights
- "Minimal" in the smoke test context means focused documentation, not bare-bones
- Launch mode integrates product(optional)→spec→build without separate plan
- Default behavior: product is optional, product runs on --full-product or meaningful product-input
- Build iterations dynamically computed as: task_count + launch_buffer (default 5)
- Documentation spread across 5 files: README, CLAUDE.md, RALPH_LOOP_REF.md, completions (bash+zsh), implementation

### Quality Gates
- shellcheck ralph.sh: Ready for validation
- grep checks for launch documentation: All passing
- Spec file format: Valid JSON with all required fields
- Task structure: Proper dependencies, clear acceptance criteria
