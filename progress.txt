## Iteration 1 - 2026-02-03

### Task Completed: US-001 Pre-flight Dependency Checks (Task 1.1)

**What was done:**
- Created `preflight_checks()` function after CONFIGURATION section
- Checks for: claude CLI (with auth validation), jq, git (and git repo status)
- Each check provides clear error messages with installation instructions
- Uses existing color/symbol conventions (RED, SYM_CROSS) for consistency
- Added `--skip-checks` flag to bypass validation for advanced users
- Integrated preflight checks into main flow before `print_header`

**Why:**
- Pre-flight checks prevent cryptic mid-session failures by verifying dependencies upfront
- Auth check catches unauthenticated claude CLI before wasting time
- Installation instructions reduce friction for new users
- `--skip-checks` flag allows advanced users to bypass when needed (e.g., offline testing)

**Files changed:**
- `ralph.sh` - Added preflight_checks() function, SKIP_CHECKS variable, --skip-checks flag parsing, help text update, main flow integration

**Verification:**
- `shellcheck ralph.sh` - Passes (only pre-existing warnings)
- `./ralph.sh --help` - Shows new --skip-checks flag
- `./ralph.sh --dry-run` - Pre-flight checks run successfully
