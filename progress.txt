## Spec Mode: Iteration 1

### Input Analysis
- Feature: Create a tiny docs-only improvement to verify launch e2e flow
- Scope: Documentation improvements only, no code changes
- Goal: Add practical examples and guidance to verify launch mode pipeline works end-to-end

### Codebase Research
- Reviewed SKILL.md for spec format requirements
- Analyzed CLAUDE.md project conventions
- Examined existing spec examples (example-tasks.json)
- Reviewed RALPH_LOOP_REF.md and RALPH_WORKSHOP.md structure
- Launch mode already implemented; documentation could be enhanced with practical examples

### Spec Design Rationale
- **T-001 (Add launch mode example to RALPH_LOOP_REF.md)**: Reference docs need concrete example showing the full pipeline
- **T-002 (Update RALPH_WORKSHOP.md launch section)**: Workshop guide should include decision tree for when to use launch variants

### Design Decisions
- Two small, independent documentation tasks (no dependencies needed)
- Each task is completable in one iteration
- Both focus on practical examples rather than reference information
- Verification via grep to ensure docs were updated

### Generated Spec
Created: `/Users/g8s/Dev/ralph-starter/specs/create-a-tiny-docs-only-improvement-to-verify-launch-e2e-flow.json`
- Format: JSON with tasks array (recommended)
- Tasks: 2 documentation updates
- Effort: small per task
- All tasks have specific, testable acceptance criteria

## Build Mode: Iteration 1

### Task
- [x] T-001: Add launch mode example to RALPH_LOOP_REF.md

### Implementation
Added comprehensive "Launch Mode Example" section to `docs/RALPH_LOOP_REF.md` immediately after the "Launch Mode defaults" paragraph (line 372). The section includes:

1. **Concrete example**: `./ralph.sh launch --skip-product -p "Add a README section explaining how to run tests"`
2. **Execution flow**: Detailed breakdown of what happens in each stage (branch creation, spec generation, build, auto-completion)
3. **Expected output**: Sample terminal output showing the full launch pipeline with spec generation and build iterations
4. **Rationale**: Explains why launch mode is ideal for docs-only improvements (speed, minimal setup, small scope, E2E verification)
5. **Decision table**: Quick reference for when to use launch mode for different scenarios

### Decisions
- Placed section right after "Launch mode defaults" for logical flow
- Used concrete, realistic example that readers can understand
- Included both command syntax and detailed narrative explanation
- Added sample output to show what success looks like
- Included decision table to help readers choose when to use launch mode

### Files Changed
- `docs/RALPH_LOOP_REF.md` (added ~80 lines with comprehensive launch mode example)

### Notes for Next Iteration
- Ready for T-002: Update RALPH_WORKSHOP.md launch section with practical guidance
- Launch mode documentation is now comprehensive with example + rationale
